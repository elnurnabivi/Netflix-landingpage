# Netflix Landing Page Clone

This project is a clone of the Netflix landing page, built using HTML and Vanilla CSS. The goal of this project was to replicate the design and layout of the original page as closely as possible, while also improving my skills in HTML and CSS.

The project was built from scratch, with no use of frameworks or libraries, only HTML and CSS. 

Feel free to use this project as a reference or as a starting point for your own projects. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let me know.

# Getting started

HTML, Vanilla CSS

# Next steps
There are still a few things that need to be done such as adding hover effects, improving the layout for larger screens and building the mobile version of the page.
